# Interactive Plot Generation for SPW Phase-up

This repository contains a Python code that generates interactive plots of the SPW phase-up based on data obtained from the 'stage14_casapy.log' file. The code utilizes the Plotly library to create scatter plots with interactive features.

## Features

- Reads data from the 'stage14_casapy.log' file.
- Processes the data and extracts relevant information.
- Generates interactive scatter plots for each dataset.
- Saves the plots as interactive HTML files.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-spw-phaseup.git
   ```

2. Place the 'stage14_casapy.log' file in the same directory as the code.

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the code:

   ```shell
   python interactive_spw_phaseup.py
   ```
